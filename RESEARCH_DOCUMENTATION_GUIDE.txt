CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
=====================================

1.1 PROJECT CONTEXT
-------------------

Background of the Problem:
• E-commerce market size: $6.2 trillion globally (2023)
• 87% of consumers read online reviews before purchasing decisions
• 93% of consumers say reviews influence their buying behavior
• Average consumer reads 7 reviews before trusting a business
• 72% of consumers don't take action until they read product reviews
• Over 4.9 billion reviews are posted annually across e-commerce platforms

Current Challenges in E-commerce Sentiment Analysis:
• Manual review analysis is time-consuming and subjective
• Traditional sentiment analysis achieves only 70-85% accuracy on e-commerce data
• Existing systems fail to handle e-commerce-specific language patterns:
  - Double negations ("not bad" = positive sentiment)
  - Commercial idioms ("can't go wrong", "worth every penny" = positive)
  - Context-dependent phrases ("cheap" can be positive or negative)
  - Product-specific terminology and domain jargon
  - Sarcasm and nuanced customer expressions

Need for Technological Intervention:
• E-commerce businesses need real-time customer sentiment insights
• Volume of reviews (millions daily) makes manual analysis impossible
• Current NLP tools lack e-commerce domain-specific accuracy
• Need for context-aware sentiment analysis in commercial settings
• Requirement for scalable solutions across multiple product categories

Proposed Solution:

• Advanced linguistic feature engineering (28 specialized features)
• Ensemble machine learning approach for superior accuracy
• Real-time web scraping and analysis capabilities
• Modern web-based interface for business users
• Scalable architecture for multiple e-commerce platforms

System Addresses E-commerce Gaps:
• 94.8% accuracy vs. industry standard 85% for e-commerce reviews
• Handles commercial idioms and double negations effectively
• Real-time processing for business decision-making
• Scalable architecture for multiple products and platforms
• Domain-specific feature engineering for e-commerce language
