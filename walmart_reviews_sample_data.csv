JeffR,5,9/26/2025,"Great machine, great bread, great mornings","Very easy to use. After months of baking great bread, we have only good things to say about this bread maker. The timer works flawlessly, the dispenser accommodates a lot of goodies, and bread turns out really well every time - BUT you must follow the recipe book  AND all instructions. DO NOT get recipes from the internet because they do not work and may initiate combustion (been there, done that)."
Pamela,5,6/11/2025,bread maker,"ditections were not very vlear, the emount of te ipes wete not much at all. overall i like the machine."
Michalios,5,4/18/2025,"I'll never ""knead"" another one!","This was a Christmas present.  I'll never ""knead"" another one!"
Frantzy Pierribia,5,12/27/2024,,"I am so in love with this bread machine! I've been using it about once per week ever since. It's great for those moments when I want fresh bread but can't be bothered to make and bake it myself. It's really easy to clean, really easy to store, and it doesn't overheat. I can even leave the house for a few hours with it running, and there's a keep warm setting once the bread is made. Mind you, we pull out the loaf immediately so it doesn't go soggy :)"
Saeed Saleh,5,12/31/2024,,"Just like it looks! I purchased the silver one, and it does great! I do like the size; it's not too big and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. The bread came out great, and everything was easy to follow. On top of that, it included a recipe book to experiment if you're new to bread-making!"
MARCIA GIELLA,5,12/30/2024,,"I had the machine set up, unboxed, clean, and was making bread within 10 minutes. It had some really good basic recipes in that booklet, and it also happened to come with all the basic tools to get started. I baked French bread twice and it went perfectly well both times. I really like the light yellow color, and it's magnetic, so I just slapped a magnet to the side to keep the booklet handy. Great Christmas gift from my wife!"
Brittany Loerzel,5,12/21/2024,,"This tiny breadmaker fits perfectly in my tiny house. It bakes fantastic bread! I really noticed the gluten-free thing. I've made four loaves so far. I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe in the manual and came up with a lighter, airier gluten-free bread by adding another teaspoon of instant yeast (if you're sensitive to it, add more) and using straight gluten-free bread flour. I'm very pleased with this machine! It fits on a shelf where it won't take up the minimal counter space I have and out of the way when not in use. Just make sure you put the paddle in before you paddle, ha!"
Alla Grutman,5,12/16/2024,,"I am really happy with this machine! It's ultra quiet and performs like a champ. It's a piece of cake to clean, and it is so easy to make bread. And it packs in so many features. The delay baking option is one of the things I like the most. It's as simple as tossing all the ingredients in before I go to bed, and it's good to go when we wake up. Such a fantastic machine!"
Brenda DaSilvasolomon,5,10/6/2024,,"I received this just yesterday, and I was so excited that I wanted to bake some bread with it! I typically do it the “old-fashioned” way — simply use my oven and patience — but it began to feel like a chore. This was the one I went with because it was a good price (thank you Prime Day deals), I liked the color and the size (doesn't take over my counter, and can even make sourdough with it (which I've never even attempted before). Everything was really simple with the instructions and I found the settings to be pretty standard, nothing too difficult to configure. It was not to late to turn back, no top end either, which I like and I still have a spare bike, which will always remain my favourite, but I really do like this machine to, and I'm proud of my purchase."
rick,1,3/23/2025,,nice unit. very poor instructions. bad user manual. some instructions did not make sense.

Derren Chan,1,12/17/2024,,"We made it work, but the machine was just a little too small. However, after a handful of uses, the buttons stopped responding so now it's a paper weight. I contacted the company to obtain a replacement, but that email didn't go through. This is a total letdown."
Heather carpenter,5,12/11/2024,,"Like others, I've noticed that the bread sometimes sticks to the glass, and while this doesn't interfere with how the bread bakes, it can be a pain to clean. That said, I'd urge you to get the machine. I typically cover it with a damp paper towel to allow it to soak for a few minutes, and then I scrub it clean with the soft side of a sponge. It adds about five to seven minutes to my cleanup time."
Cendrella mounayar,5,12/17/2024,,"And my shopping for a bread maker took some time because I was nervous about the price and wanted something that looked nice as well. This one is fantastic! I've tried a few settings and only used their recipe book and everything came out incredible every time! If you get one, I'd recommend buying a digital scale to weigh the ingredients as it's more precise. Honestly, I had this bread maker in my cart for weeks and put off pulling the trigger and I'm so glad I did—totally worth it!"
Bangki Paik,1,12/15/2024,,"You have some control — adjusting time for most settings, but baking is capped at 60 minutes. You can do that on most budget gear, anyway. I wrestled with this machine for months, assuming the issue was the recipe. But if you want gluten-free bread that's been fully baked through, you'll have to do so manually, restarting the baking cycle after the first cycle runs through."
Lorenzo Rothschild,5,10/12/2024,,"This one makes the most beautiful loaf right in your very own kitchen! Pro Tip: Bring your own measuring tools, because, the plastic one-size-fits-all cup they give you is not worth the hassle. You'll see that liquids and dry ingredients do not measure the same way. The photo above is from their basic recipe, and the texture was so perfect that you won't want to make anything, and put anything, with it. Plus, its built-in double heater provides an incredible crust and a great crumb texture. I posted this on Facebook, and every single friend of mine was so intrigued! Tired of paying $5.45 for a half loaf of bread? This also stitched together your email, saving some bucks and yielding a far better output."
carlos ruiz,5,12/10/2024,,"This bread machine was gifted to me last year and I've been using it for a little over a month and I LOVE it and highly recommend it! A little tip: when you've finished baking and want to turn off the warmer, press and hold, don't just press. The button does get a little hot so I use a hot pad or washcloth to do this. It won't scorch you, but it's not the best thing to touch barehanded. I love the silver stainless steel model and it looks great on my countertop in my small kitchen. It's not too big, so I can leave it out without it bothering me. Honestly, I cannot recommend this machine any more! If anything ever happens to it, I'd get another instantaneously. Now I'm never going back to life without a bread machine!"
Dedelind,5,9/1/2024,,"I've been making bread from scratch for 50 years. I also take my bread machine to festivals and share what I made! This is my third machine, and actually this is the best machine I used, to be honest. The first one I owned eventually wore out, and the fancy KBS model with its two paddles turned out to be a real disappointment. But this one? This one is pretty rugged and pretty durable. It's a much better design, it's easy to clean, and I can make three perfect loaves using different kinds of flour and different recipes. I love that it's square for sandwiches, and appreciate the choice of a two-pound loaf. And when it's working, it's so quiet. Truly the best I've ever had!"
Maria Arvi,5,9/7/2024,,"Now, this is a tough machine that works like a charm! The guidelines and recipes are super simple to follow. Do a little experimenting with the buttons and settings before you start baking. It does its job very well and works great. It does end up a bit noisy, though, so a little advice I got is to use it in a place where nobody else would mind your noise. And the scent of fresh bread wafts through the house! Overall, especially considering the unit price — it's a great desktop!"
Annmarie caggiano,5,9/2/2024,,"This machine is solid and a fairly simple bit of kit, but it may take a few goes to figure out. You just have to follow the instructions and note the timing for mixing, resting and fermenting. That allows you to remove the paddle before it begins baking. Aside from that, it's actually a really solid machine!"
Cendrella mounayar,5,12/17/2024,,"And my shopping for a bread maker took some time because I was nervous about the price and wanted something that looked nice as well. This one is fantastic!

Anita Warnemuende,5,10/30/2024,,"I got this machine and the Panasonic one at the same time because I needed a bread maker for gluten free. I honestly couldn't tell any difference (or have any preference) between the bread from either one after having checked both of them out. The Panasonic is significantly larger and resembles a large stainless steel box. But this one is actually really compact, stylish, and the big window on the top is perfect for watching how the baking is going. And it's $200 less than the Panasonic!"
Robert Holmes,1,12/19/2024,,"This was mentioned by someone else as well. The first time I used it, there was a burnt-plastic smell. The second and third loaves were super-seasoned, but I still caught a whiff of something weird and toxic. Not sure if it's the unit itself or the plastic cover on the bottom, but either way — EW! The smell from these things is just not acceptable after multiple tries. I'm absolutely giving it back at my earliest opportunity."
George Aginaga,5,12/17/2024,,"I really love this little machine! It is super easy to use, a snap to clean up and it also looks great. I'd definitely rate it 5 stars for that. Unfortunately, its included recipes are somewhat disappointing. There are only a few, and they are essentially all variations of plain white bread. They're delicious and we really need more variety. Where's the monkey bread, cinnamon raisin, honey wheat, all that good stuff? It would be nice if they would at least direct us to a website with more recipes. Otherwise, if you're comfortable with a little bit of experimentation in trying out new ones, I'd say get this bread maker without a doubt!"
Lucia Nunez,5,9/25/2024,,"For instance, I typically look at the 1-star and 2-star reviews first to find out what people struggle with. There was also a fair amount of reference to odd smells and smoke. But I makes the sweet bread and threw in some raisins and cinnamon and it turned out yummy! I didn't even wait to add the raisins at the appropriate moment — I threw them in right away. I ended up doing two loaves of cinnamon raisin and two loaves of French and they all came out perfectly delicious. Can't say enough good things about this bread machine!"
Darren Kinslow,2,12/25/2024,,"The machine came with this flimsy tool to yank the paddle out with, but nothing in there works right now, just stuck. And the weight measurements are only the first problem, even when I follow the weight measurements the bread ends up super inconsistent. And it's not near a window, the stove, temperature changes. Now I sort of regret not splurging on the pricier version because at least I would have put it to use. I really miss my $2 vintage garage sale find — that one always worked perfectly."
Pamela Lewis,5,11/16/2024,,"I love bread making machine very much! So far, I've baked sweet bread and even a ciabatta-like variant. All you do is throw in your ingredients, choose a program for the type of bread, and leave it to work its magic! It's awesome. It is just amazing the smells of fresh bread filling the air. Sugar-free options are hard to find or pricey, so this baby seriously pays for itself!"
Alla Grutman,5,12/16/2024,,"I am really happy with this machine! It's ultra quiet and performs like a champ. It's a piece of cake to clean, and it is so easy to make bread.

Jody Bell,2,12/24/2024,,"At least twice a week I pick this up, and wash it out by hand every single time, I picked this up back in November. Now, the coating is beginning to bubble up and peel! This isn't great! You don't really make bread with a non-stick coating like that. I'm really disappointed!"
Regina Zarate,5,11/18/2024,,"Tonight was my first loaf of gluten free bread! I am trying to bake my own so I picked this up to assist. For the batter I used Mom's Place gluten free mix and it turned out so yummy! I look forward to trying out more recipes! The bread itself came out perfectly, with a soft crust that was set to medium darkness."
michael Medeiros,1,12/15/2024,,"I've had this for roughly a month, and the bread quality has been rather uneven — I cannot figure out quite why, as I have some experience in this department. And one week after the warranty expired, I wiped it down with a dry cloth and all the writing came off! The company is only offering me a $10 refund, and I don't think that's fair at all. It shouldn't transfer like that. Honestly, the customer service from both the company and the shop isn't helpful at all, and I will never recommend this or purchase it again."

Audra DeProto,5,9/16/2024,,"That's what I had read — that bread makers, this one included, would heat the room up well. At first I was disappointed with the taste of the bread. I was like, you know what, let me try a couple more recipes because honestly the sweet bread could be a bit cake-like or just more like a dessert because you leave out the raisins. I was surprisingly able to bake a loaf that was quite close to a perfect glittery classic white bread! It's truly delightful, and now I can't stop baking it. The other basic and quick bread recipes in this book are all so heavy and so dense, tasting like a dry, flavorless cake… just awful. Write these off, get this and forget the ones in your cart. You won't regret it!"

Noe Ortiz,5,11/12/2024,,"This machine is great — loving it so far! But you've gotta learn how it operates. For instance, I wanted to prepare something with Quick Oats, but I didn't have any. So, I Googled what to use instead, and whoop, said to replace it with all-purpose flour, in equal measure. I gave it a shot, and wow! I ended up with a giant loaf that was all the way to the window of the machine. It was delicious, but it was huge! Today, I had my oats, I used it, and I got a beautiful loaf of bread, as you can see. It's all about learning as you go — just like in life. Not to mention, this machine is so low-cost. I'm having a blast with it!"
Robert Holmes,1,12/19/2024,,"This was mentioned by someone else as well. The first time I used it, there was a burnt-plastic smell.

Maria andrade,5,10/27/2024,,"I really enjoy this product! I have a small boat, and since I cook on that boat often, I do not have much space, and I have to manage the things that occupy my countertop. I'm also digging the green color. It's another case where it's usually just my husband and me baking a loaf, which takes about three hours. I look on Pinterest for recipes and modify them to work for me. Today, I took some raisin bread I made and used the sweet bread setting to toast it dark and let me tell you, it tastes so much better in the morning than anything from the store. I would recommend this box for rolling and kneading if you are low on space. I also add two tablespoons of milk powder to my bread, either machine or by hand, for the rise."

Rodolfo Janagap,5,9/5/2024,,"I love baking our own sandwich bread, and these small loaves are perfect. They're a little smaller, but as we live in Florida, the bread does rather quickly get stale, so the smaller size suits us just fine. The bread maker mixes and kneads the dough like a champ, and I've got no complaints about how it operates or the final product. It's extremely intuitive, though I've only tested it with regular white bread so far. Definitely a great purchase!"
Darren Kinslow,2,12/25/2024,,"The machine came with this flimsy tool to yank the paddle out with, but nothing in there works right now, just stuck.

Ellen Gomez,5,10/24/2024,,"We recently got this machine to make a bit of pizza dough for some family dinners, and it was shockingly easy to use! It was a fantastic dough, and everyone enjoyed serving their own personal pizzas! It is slightly noisy, but nothing insane — y'know, because it's a machine! Actually, I have not run into any issues with it at all. Quality of work: It does precisely what you want it to do; it is super intuitive to use with nice, easy-to-read settings. All in all, it's a great product for a great price!"
Veronica cortes jacobo,5,11/10/2024,,"I am SO in love with this bread maker! I love the color and it makes great bread. The recipes are also super simple. Unfortunately, the first one I received was defective — the display became unresponsive. However, the manufacturer immediately replaced it for me, great customer service. The only thing I don't love about it — and which is just a minor gripe at best — is the beeping that starts when it's time to add ingredients and when it's done baking. It's not that loud, so if I'm in another room, I can't hear it. If I need to add something, I just watch the time and set my own timer. I would definitely recommend this for bread making, not to mention the nice smell in your house!"
Brian Riggles,1,12/16/2024,,"I bought this bread maker and to be honest, it just did not live up to our expectations at all. I've been using bread makers since 1998, and this is the first one I disliked enough to want to return it. The instructions were difficult to follow, and the settings and loaves were small — even using the larger recipes. I would not recommend this to anyone. We made a lot of recipes in the manual and kept getting all sorts of disappointing results."
Amy Khan,5,12/3/2024,,"I am really enjoying this bread maker! Ever since I started baking bread myself, it's been so nice just to throw all the ingredients in one machine and have it do its thing. It kneads, rises, bakes and even keeps the bread warm for an hour, in case I can't grab it right away."

Antonio Reinhardt,5,12/28/2024,,"This thing is so versatile and has some great recipes! It's fully programmable and that simple to use. You simply add in the ingredients, select your program and walk away. Then, two hours later (when you get back home) a wonderful bread awaits you!"
Lisa Weakley,2,12/26/2024,,"First of all, it is super easy to just use the presets but the bread does not come out good and there is always a hole at the bottom. I was quite disappointed, so I returned it."
Aracelie M Encarnacion,5,12/22/2024,,One of the things that became clear over Thanksgiving was how much someone wanted to start baking her own bread. That is why Santa decided to find the perfect special gift to put under the tree for Christmas!
oscarmcdonald,5,11/8/2024,,"I was just tired of having to buy bread or having pizza that I couldn't eat because of the allergies. Then I received this device and I just love it! It's compact, portable and cooks just the right amount."
Celia Harrison,5,12/1/2024,,"We've found this absolutely game changing for us! With all those pre set options, we can easily make bread at home without shelling out a got to the store price."
Lidia Aldana,5,10/29/2024,,If only I got this sooner... We're absolutely loving it! It's easy to read and really beautiful to look at!” We've already made four loaves of delicious bread!
Carlos Corredor,5,12/24/2024,,"My first loaf was quite dense because the yeast was faulty. That out of the way, things went smoothly, otherwise. Also, the recipes included were absolutely lovely and very useful. This bread maker is so easy to use, I love it!"
Theresa Phillips,5,10/16/2024,,My husband and I picked this up for baking our own bread. I typically bake some French bread; she tends to experiment with specialty loaves such as banana bread.

Larisa Snyder,5,12/12/2024,,This is honestly the best bread machine I've ever used! The texture is great and there are no lumps at all. It's primarily simple to clean and maintain. I'm really happy with it!
Lilian Alfaro,5,11/7/2024,,"We just baked our first loaf of bread, and it was successful! It was a little dense but there are loads of recipes to play around with. I'm excited to try more!"

STEVE BERNHARD,5,11/1/2024,,I absolutely love this bread maker! The size is also great for my kitchen counter and even for bringing on camping trips. And it smells amazing to have fresh bread baking!
Cheryl Cruz,5,11/17/2024,,Awesome bread maker! My Breads1 — This was my first time ever baking bread and it was amazing. The buttons are extremely easy to decode. It's a good deal and super sturdy. You should totally get it!
Cyn Brown,5,11/3/2024,,I have already made a couple of loaves of bread and they were great! It even includes a recipe book that teaches how to make different types of bread.
brian vaughn,5,9/17/2024,,"We are so in love with our machine! It is really easy to use and the directions are super simple. The delay function works a dream, and it fills the house at just the right time with the most beautiful smell!"
Brian Fields,5,9/4/2024,,"Everything functions as advertised, except for one hitch: the bread basket is a squeeze inside the machine. I have big hands, so getting the basket in and out is a little bit of a struggle for me. Besides that, it's been great!"
Altagracia Ciprian,5,5/26/2024,,"I finally decided to purchase this machine after 10 years with the old Oster. I thought it was time for an upgrade, especially since I hate vertical pans. One of my favorite features is the automatic release — it tells me when it's time to go, without me having to wait for a beep. But when the lid is open, it hangs down kind of low, which can present an issue for taller loaves because they have a tendency to get a little squished on one side. But honestly, I think that's a good trade-off. Oh, and did I mention that in the fruit / nut cycle it leaves a really loud bang whether or not the container is attached? The first time it's a little jarring, but then you get used to it."
Elizabeth jimenez,5,6/10/2024,,"I looked at about 15 different bread machines to compare their sizes, prices and extra features other than just making bread. Setting the price aside, this machine can churn out three loaf sizes in around 3.2 hours. I've recorded all the different breads I've attempted so far, and I used the recipes from the machine for my first go-around with each one. This model is one I recommend highly, most if you like to tinker with a recipe a little. You won't be let down!"
Carrol knight,5,6/22/2024,,"I purchased this bread machine so I would know exactly what I have in my bread, and that it doesn't contain preservatives. Now, I'm baking a fresh loaf about every ten days or so, and I truly wish I had bought one sooner. It's really simple: Just toss in the ingredients, in the right order and in the right amounts, place the container in the machine, select your recipe and setting for the crust, press ""START,"" and boom! In roughly 3.5 hours, my kitchen smells of fresh bread, and I have a warm loaf ready to go. I've even stopped buying bread from the store – I bake it myself! I highly advise this machine."
Mario Ramirez,5,6/27/2024,,"I encountered some issues with this breadmaker. I whizzed a midnight email over to the company on a Saturday night, and got a genuine shock when they replied all the next morning on the Sunday! I'm not going to get into all the particulars, but I think it was a one-time issue — the tempered glass lid broke. The company became extremely worried about it. We exchanged at least 10 emails going back and forth, them really trying to understand what went wrong. ""We even asked for photos and the machine's identification number so it could be sent to their research team to ensure nobody else has the same problem."" I love their dedication to their product and the satisfaction of their customers!"
Linton EJFranklin,5,8/16/2024,,"Now every time I bake I get perfect bread! The two heat sources allow for even baking of everything. It even features 17 preset options, and you can customize the loaf dimensions and crust hue. And, it has a ton of recipes. I always use organic bread flour — it's the only way to avoid glyphosate (as in what's in Roundup) in my diet."
kerrie webb,5,5/30/2024,,"I've used my machine twice, and I'm quite satisfied with how it's performing. I took the recipe for basic butter bread and set it for 2lb loaf and medium crust. When the loaf was finished, it came out of the pan so easily—just flipped over, and it just slipped right out! I look forward to experimenting with some more difficult recipes next."
Armando Guillen,5,5/14/2024,,"I use this bread machine all the time! It's super user-friendly. A non toxic, nonstick ceramic pan for bread machines is hard to come by. Not to mention, you can create your own recipes! (I haven't yet tried the jam setting.) I did have an issue with the blade getting stuck, but Customer Service was back to me (even over the weekend!) in less than 24 hours!"
Carmen Baroza Rios,5,7/31/2024,,"This bread maker is awesome! I'm not particularly a cooking person, and I've always thought making bread from scratch was an awful lot of work — it's complicated, it takes forever and it's such a pain to get the yeast to cooperate. But this machine makes it effortless! You spend 10 to 15 minutes putting everything into the pan, which you then turn on, and then you can walk away. When it beeps, you return to loaves baked to perfection!"
patricia castro,5,8/7/2024,,"I absolutely love this bread machine! I was truly blown away by how well it works and how user-friendly it is right from the get-go. Oh, and just so you know, I was totally blown away by the customer service because they were great! I had a minor issue and they responded back to me the next day and resolved it immediately. I would absolutely recommend this machine to everyone!"
Cindy vandermeiden,5,6/29/2024,,"I opened it up Friday and baked some bread the following day. I used an online recipe for Pepperoni and Mozzarella bread, which reminds me of what I used to see my mom make. I landed on setting 1 and medium browning. Three hours later, boom — pepperoni bread! It wasn't as awesome as mom's, but not too shabby for my first time ever making bread, so I was there :) I ordered a bread machine recipe book, which came on Sunday. I intend to make another one for Thanksgiving! Now all I need to do is get started on what kind of bread to bake … so many options!"
Arlett Lee,5,5/20/2024,,"This bread maker is great! We first got a black stainless steel version, but it had a tiny chip on the door so we exchanged it for a plain stainless steel version, which is less susceptible to chipping. It serves great bread, but the menu can be a little confusing to get through — you have to tap on and tap off to get through, which doesn't really make sense. Now we're returning with the black stainless, which bakes perfect loaves. For what it's worth: it leaves a pretty good hole from the paddle."
Tania Scutt St Louis,5,5/2/2024,,"It's completely transformed my world!) Since we got it, we've been making rolls and homemade bread about once a week. It's so easy to toss in a few ingredients and voila our home smells like fresh bread. I can't recommend it enough! It was always nice and mixed perfectly."
Juan A Gomez,5,6/16/2024,,"I purchased this for my wife in March, and she had no idea how much she would love it. She seriously loves it! We haven't purchased any store-bought bread since — now, we're eating through about 3 to 4 loaves per week.” It is, honestly, the best bread in the world. But, something weird happened last week and the pan started to wobble. I contacted customer service and they sent me a new pan for free, even if it was 8 months after I purchased it. It has great people to work with. If you don't already have one then don't hesitate getting one!"
Marietta Bislig,5,8/14/2024,,"Now I am using this bread machine for more than two years and I can say that it was my good investment. It's really easy, cleans up nice and there's nothing like fresh bread! And it just looks so nice sitting out on the counter, and doesn't slide around. I highly recommend this machine!"
derrick sawney,5,5/14/2024,,"I bought a bread maker recently and at first I was loving the design and how easy it was to use. After a couple of months, though, I ran into a problem — the machine suddenly just stopped working. I reached out to customer service to see if they would give me a break. I was very impressed with how fast it got sorted out, I was told just a couple days later that it was sent to me a new machine. So, despite a few hiccups with the bread maker, the positive customer service made this a pretty good experience overall. Looking forward to some fresh bread with the replacement soon!"
Raluca Lascu,5,5/8/2024,,"I use this bread maker at least once a week, and it's awesome! It's so easy to use and the bread always turns out fantastic. I normally make 1.5- or 2-pound loaves. I was because I could no longer knead dough by hand and my KitchenAid mixer just couldn't keep up with the kneading. It's truly a great machine!"
Rosa Vaquerano,5,7/3/2024,,"I had a problem as soon as I started, but don't let that put you off! The customer service I received went above and beyond, even better than the bread this machine makes! I contacted them, and they responded within mere hours — so quickly, I almost missed their response. They know what is wrong, tell me what to do next, and we are good to go.” My family and I are completely in love with this machine! I look forward to futzing around with it much more. And a big thank you to John for his help as well! He was super sweet, and he truly wants us to enjoy this amazing machine. Thank you, John! You're amazing!"
Anthony Banks,5,5/25/2024,,"I LOVE MY 17-IN-1 BREAD MACHINE! I've had it for maybe three weeks, and I have already baked 11 loaves of various recipes, each of which have come out great and popped right out of the ceramic pan without any grief. I did have a bit of trouble with the paddle sticking to the pan, but the customer service team was very, very speedy in helping me. They provided a few tips on getting the paddle out and how to avoid the problem next time, then sent me a replacement pan and paddle that arrived in just two days. Euro Cuisine Bread Machine | Definitely recommend this one!! It makes great bread, and the customer support was excellent. Who would have thought baking could be so easy?"
Rhonda Lynch,5,6/11/2024,,"The children prefer it to storebought bread anyway, especially with all those other ingredients. It's really easy to just throw the stuff in the machine and let it do its thing. Before you realize it, you have new bread! At the moment, their favorite is the French bread I make. Fresh bread at home is just so wonderful, and it tastes so good!"
Leslie Crowley,5,6/23/2024,,"I recently got a used bread machine, and because this is my first time ever owning a bread machine, I'd always wanted one, and just never had a reason to have one. Honestly, with all the crap they put in our food, and the ridiculous prices at the register nowadays, I thought now would be as good a time as ever to go in. The image is of my first attempt and I am shocked how cool the bread was!"
Fatou Samb,5,7/14/2024,,"I'm sure many of you, like me, spent a fair amount of time researching various bread machines, considering the pros and cons of each. When my machine eventually arrived, I had a little run in with one of the paddles (it comes with two). I called John, whose contact information is also listed there, and he replied instantly. He is shipping me a new set of paddles, which was awesome. It was a fast, very professional approach. Their customer service made me feel good about my purchase. I would absolutely order from them again!"

Noa levi,5,7/17/2024,,"Very simple and user friendly machine! I've made several loaves of bread and a few rolls, and all have come out well. I used the soft bread recipe from the booklet to make the bread, and it was a big hit with everyone. So, I had to pull it up. I contacted customer service, and they responded quickly with a few tips. I tried them but the paddle was still stuck. Now, they're shipping me a new one of each to see if that makes a difference. Fingers crossed! Oh, and the nut dispenser operates brilliantly!"
Katrina Mackey,5,5/7/2024,,"It bakes bread in as little as three hours, so that's pretty handy. It takes less than two minutes to throw in the ingredients. The loaf stays fresh for approximately three days—the clock is ticking, though, as it hardens after that—but hey, at least it's organic!"
Theresa James,5,5/31/2024,,"This is my second breadmaker. My initial one was about 15 years ago and I used it for approximately a year. I decided on an Oatmeal bread and the smallest setting, recommended for first-timer. Dinner is often the same dish for the entire family, and a lot of people noted that a great number of recipes are in weight and not in the volume, which I notice the recipe book has options for both now. I borrowed a scale this time, and I'm finding that weighing ingredients is so much easier than measuring 1 2/3 cups of this or that. Also looking forward to baking more bread! :)"
Gora Beye,5,5/31/2024,,"Many years later, but I'd never owned a bread machine before, however I had seen this type of machine and wanted to take a shot because I grew tired of eating stale bread that only tasted okay once toasted. It is really easy to use — I throw in the ingredients in maybe 5 minutes and I'm off. Once I mix in some hot water, I simply let the dough rest and do its thing. I'd also recommend you grab a copy of the No Fuss Bread Making book that is available online, especially if you're new in the bread-making world. I haven't even attempted any of the recipes that came with the machine; I just always go with the ones in that book because they use less ingredients — usually things that most people have at home — and they're always incredible!"
Aurelia Soto,5,6/15/2024,,"I've owned my bread maker for around a year, and put it to use countless times. It's been terrific, but a month or so ago I noticed some dough leaking out of the barrel and dripping onto the mechanism below. I contacted their customer service, and they responded to my email within minutes, very quick. They asked me some questions and immediately shipped me a new barrel. What a fantastic experience!"
Itz Nora,5,8/15/2024,,"My first bread machine was an ancient thrift store model from the 1980s. It worked, and yet I could never get anything out of it that was anything but OK, regardless of recipe. I've used my new machine three times so far. I made a plain white bread as my first loaf just to give it a test run, and it turned out really great! Then baked two wonderful loaves of vegan cinnamon raisin that were amazing. I'm really happy with it! I was not thrilled with the price, but I was looking for something better than the cheapest options, and I wasn't looking to spend a fortune. I decided to hold out for a sale, and I'm so glad I did!"
Afaf A Yanni,5,6/13/2024,,"The owner responded immediately, despite it being a year and a half since I purchased it. They immediately sent out a replacement which really blew my mind! I bought a bread maker for my daughter, and she's really enjoying it as well. I use mine to bake bread for our family of three; she bakes loaves for her family of six, adding yogurt to the mix. It is a great machine! Now that I'm older, with each overripe banana I own I make banana bread because I no longer have to pull the mixer from the shelf. I give it to my neighbors and they really like it. This has really helped me develop some wonderful friendships in the area!"
Shirl Mckay,5,6/29/2024,,"I just made a gluten free loaf and it is fantastic! It always sunk in the middle with my old machine, but this one did great! The mixing paddle, for one, didn't get stuck in the bread — it stayed in the machine when I took the loaf out! I've used it once and I really like this machine so far!"
Maurice Belle,5,7/19/2024,,"When I baked a loaf of sourdough bread with the real San Francisco starter, the mixing paddle was stuck in the pan. Even though the bread came out awesome, I was intensely irritated with that paddle just sitting there. I soaked it in hot water for hours, and it wouldn't release. But when I asked for help, I was sent a new pan and paddle, and super fast — much faster than the original delivery of the machine from the store. Since then I've been baking amazing bread with no problem!"
Carol Fitz,5,6/24/2024,,"I had been such a newbie for bread machine usage. I had so many questions when attempting my grandma's recipes. I shot them a quick email, and to my surprise, they wrote back immediately and we exchanged messages and chatted back and forth for four days! The recipes are great, and if you're new to baking bread, it doesn't get any easier. And, their customer service is outstanding!"
Rhonda Lynch,5,6/11/2024,,"The children prefer it to storebought bread anyway, especially with all those other ingredients.

Paul Parrington,5,8/6/2024,,"I got my bread machine, made my first loaf of bread and it was a hit! But the paddle was stuck in the bowl. I read a few other reviews saying this (the linking problem) and giving tips on how to solve it, but when I tried them, they didn't help me. So I reached out to customer service. They offered some more suggestions, but none of them worked, either. They ultimately sent me a replacement bowl and paddle, and now it works like a charm! No more stuck paddle, and I am treated to fresh-baked, homemade bread whenever I want! I'm so pleased with my purchase and so impressed with the customer service!"

It's way better for you than the store-bought one loaded with preservatives. I did have a little bit of trouble with the paddle getting stuck in the bread pan. I contacted customer service, and they were extremely fast and easy to assist in getting me a new pan. Their customer service is really good too, to be honest!"
Dawn Davis,5,8/15/2024,,"This thing is awesome and so simple to use! I was quite scared to bake bread as I've never done that. But seriously, as long as you follow the instructions and add the ingredients in the right order, you'll have excellent bread. We've eliminated store-bought bread completely and now bake at home pretty much every day. My children and grandchildren have a lot of fun making the bread and love eating it warm with butter. It does make smaller loaves, but we wanted that option—we wanted to get comfortable with fronting the bread-making before we sprung for a larger model. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking into getting a bread maker!"
Josefa,5,6/20/2024,,"I've always wanted to make my own breades at home, but didn't get it exactly until now. Everything I bake in a bread maker, not just sourdough. It even makes cakes! We loved it so much we bought a second one to give as a gift to a friend! Its instructions are truly simple, and it needs no construction. Just toss in your ingredients, set the machine to the kind of bread you want and let it do its job. We have had an awesome experience with this bread machine. We highly recommend it!"

shirlanne frisk,5,6/22/2024,,"We got the 17-in-one bread maker and had a few questions regarding it. We did a ton of research on different brands and models before deciding on this one. We all know how important excellent customer service is, and that's why we're so pleased we selected this product."" John was very easy to work with and extremely responsive to our concerns. We've had home bread makers for more than 30 years, and we believe this makes awesome and delicious bread — it also makes yogurt! With its dual heater for more even baking and nut-fruit dispenser, it really has everything you'll need. Overall an amazing option for the price!"

Sybrina Bradley,5,7/17/2024,,"This bread maker is rock solid and incredibly versatile. Cleaning it is a breeze! Within two days I was churning out some delicious multi-grain bread and pizza dough, thanks to their manual with an ingredient list. They also have excellent customer service. My beloved bread maker arrived with a small nick in one of its stirring paddles (it has two). I contacted them and sent a photo of the paddle. They responded the same day, and immediately sent me a new paddle and pan."

The recipes are easy, which is ideal for someone like me who is a novice. Each loaf has raved and nothing beats making toast with fresh bread. Overall very happy with my purchase and would certainly recommend."
Jon Serviss,2,12/28/2024,,"The plastic measuring cup arrived broken, and I was told that the sole way to obtain a new one was to return the entire machine."
Sommay Pansophan,5,1/1/2025,,I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she made her first loaf of bread. Well it turned out amazing and she is just so thrilled with it!
Miguel P Lanuza,5,12/27/2024,,"I've so far only made the quick bread recipe, but I am seriously in love with this! It makes it so easy to whip up bread!"
Maria Aguiniga,5,8/31/2024,,"What's not to adore? It has tons of pre-set options and works great. Plus, it also makes jellies and yogurt!"
Angela Wallace,5,9/1/2024,,Girlfriend and I are super into this bread maker! Also the manual is very helpful as well. We absolutely endorse this brand!
Pamela CoxWilson,5,9/5/2024,,"It's my first one, so I can't really compare it to other bread machines. But if I'm honest, I love it so much!"
Tomoko Guthrie,2,12/25/2024,,"This was great for two months, then the bread gets stuck and doesn't want to come up. Time to get a new machine!"
Helen cyr,5,9/28/2024,,"It's super user-friendly. I'm thankful that it comes with a recipe book right in the box. And, best of all, it cleans up super easy!"
Maria jaquez,5,9/26/2024,,This is my first bread maker and I am super impressed! It's very easy to use and easy to clean. I love every bit of it!

Beatriz munguia,5,5/18/2024,,"It's nice when this bread works well, but be careful not to make too much. It gets really hard if you don't eat it within a couple of days. Better to bake only as much as you can get today — and possibly tomorrow."
Jimmie Rush,5,8/13/2024,,"It is quiet and does an excellent job. The loaf of bread every time seems to come out just the way it should be baked, and has a great texture. Plus, they taste delicious! A very satisfied customer."
Ronda Calef,5,6/9/2024,,"It couldn't be any easier, really: fill it up, push a button, and eat your meal! The setup is super convenient, and the recipes are quite simple to follow, too."
Arnie Torres,5,8/17/2024,,"This place has the best customer service! The bread is really amazing -- I've made a bunch of different kinds, and I've learned that sifting the flour is key. Thank you for all of your help!"
Huiyue Zhu,5,6/15/2024,,"I rarely stop to write a review unless something leaves me wowed. But I do have to say that this machine is great! It's super easy to operate. The nut and fruit dispenser is tuned perfectly, dispensing the right amount of fruit."
Leah Ramirez,5,8/11/2024,,"I make two different recipes for bread and they both taste good and come out nice! The black machine is a stunner on my counter surfaces, and it plays well with my other appliances. Exactly what you need, and it comes at a price."
Tabitha Goodner,5,5/5/2024,,"Once every few days, I make bread at home! One small issue is that I can't get the paddle off, so I need to use a toothpick to get in beneath it. I do love the non-stick tub and the twin heating elements, though!"
Iuliia Prysiazhniuk,5,8/4/2024,,"I make my bread with einkorn flour only and it's delicious! It's really easy — throw in the ingredients, flip the switch and we have a tasty loaf in three hours. I also make gluten-free bread, and it's amazing for those loaves as well!"
Jimmie Rush,5,8/13/2024,,"It is quiet and does an excellent job. The loaf of bread every time seems to come out just the way it should be baked, and has a great texture. Plus, they taste delicious! A very satisfied customer."

Dale Doyle,5,5/27/2024,,"I purchased this for the gluten-free baking option, and it has been amazing! And the bread turns out delicious every single time."
maria quijada,5,7/26/2024,,I am really loving this breadmaker! Every loaf I've baked has turned out perfectly. So glad I finally got rid of my old one!

Malena Garcia,5,7/21/2024,,"I'm new to using bread machines, and this one was really easy to use! My first loafs were spot on! I'm really addicted to baking bread now!"
Veronica Locke,5,6/22/2024,,I'm really into this machine! It's great for making a fast loaf of bread and I love that I can manage my ingredients!
Mariela Ruvalcaba,5,6/6/2024,,This bread machine paid for itself many times over! I'm having a lot of fun with all the delicious breads I've been able to make with it.
Patricia Molina,5,8/23/2024,,We enjoyed a great deal baking our very own bread at home! It's really easy to use and tastes great. And the cleanup is easy.
jose Carmen,5,8/20/2024,,"Very easy to use and has lots of delicious bread recipes! It is super easy to use and clean, so I no longer buy bread at the store."
Paul Rocha,5,2/20/2024,,"I bought the breadmaker because I read the reviews and they were good. After exploring other routes, I thought this one was bang for your buck.” After using it to bake, I'm quite happy with how everything's turned out, although the dispenser hasn't been tested yet."
LLOYD WEAVER,4,8/16/2023,,"Hurrys up with the first bread maker, I love this, it is perfect. I picked one up on the Deal Day sale, and I can honestly say it was a good buy. The quality is genuinely spectacular. The only thing I am not happy, is that I wish I could have ordered an additional recipe book or manual for it. I lost mine and haven't had any luck replacing it, unfortunately. I'd totally give it five stars if not for that!"
Linda Moore,5,4/28/2024,,"This is my second bread machine and I really appreciate that I'm able to prepare 2 loaves at a time! It is actually fun to make bread with this machine. Here's my best advice for all you bread machine users out there: Watch your dough during the first 5-10 minutes of kneading. If it's only sticking to the mixing paddle, give it a tablespoon of water at a time. And if the ingredients are clinging to the sides of the pot, add in a tablespoon of flour at a time. Enjoy your baking!"
Deborah Myles-Riley,5,3/28/2024,,"I grew up on a DAK Turbo Baker, that old-school bread machine, so I've got some long-standing experience baking bread. I like to bake my own bread from scratch without machine. The beeping can get a bit loud, but it's not really a big deal. It can actually be useful if you want to add things such as raisins while it's running. Mine hasn't shifted around on the counter one drop but I did orient the cord so that it would unplug itself if it went sliding off. And just a warning — the Hitachi bread that comes out of these machines when it's fresh isn't bad at all, but it's not on the level of homemade bread, so just remember that!"
Myron Kuhns,5,12/16/2023,,"We love our bread machine so much! We use it three to four times a week. It is somewhat big, but I think that is sort of the nature of the bread machines. The upside, though, is that this one's relatively lightweight, so putting it away isn't a huge chore. Super happy with this buy!"
Katherine moton,5,4/24/2024,,"The breadmaker I purchased was the MBF-011 Bread Maker in October 2023 (picked the store around) and I'm loving that machine! I did make a mistake, though—I forgot to remove the stirring rod when I cut the bread. I was actually going to buy a replacement, but they sent me a brand-new bread pan and stirring rod for free! Best customer service ever! I highly recommend this bread maker!"
Elizabeth Garibaldi,5,4/20/2024,,"This seller gets my strong recommendation! So I contacted them regarding a problem I was having with my bread machine and they responded within a couple of hours. It took a bit of back and forth to get sorted out, but they responded to each of my follow-ups in minutes until everything sorted out. Their customer service is literally top notch — 10 stars giveable. I have been using this bread machine for about six months, and it is incredible. My family enjoys it so much, I can hardly keep up with the requests!"
Ronald Moraga,4,7/20/2023,,"It works well, but it doesn't beep when it's time to add the nuts, fruit and seeds, as my other ones do. I really love the color! One thing I've noticed is that some of the liquid recipes aren't listed in ounces, forcing me to convert them to milliliters."
Sandy Perez,3,6/15/2023,,"Getting to know it was a total breeze — it was so easy to use that I was honestly a little shocked. That said, I attempted to cook a range of different recipes, none of which turned out well. I didn't care for the taste or texture, or really anything about the bread itself. I'm not much of a baker, so perhaps you'll fare better with it!"
Bogdan Hart,4,9/11/2023,,"This bread maker is awesome, but good luck getting customer service to have a new instruction manual sent if you lose the original! I searched for a PDF, but all that came up was a collection of random instructions for making alternative bread. This can definitely cost you customers because little things like this can really drive customers to go elsewhere… just a suggestion!”"
Matt Betenson,4,7/14/2023,,"I'm changing my review because the last several loaves turned out really well! The timer feature is wonderful, to set it so that you get a fresh loaf of warm bread out of the oven just in time to greet my starving 14-year-old when he gets home from school. My ingredients are fresh, and the yeast is active. The bread, indeed, is quite dense, and the top doesn't brown at all, and you can get it in two sizes that are both pretty small. I'm going to keep experimenting, but the first three recipes I tried for a fast and basic whole wheat bread turned out mediocre."
Thomas Caruso,3,4/7/2023,,"I've had this thing for several months, and I've baked with it multiple times, but my go-to dough recipe is no longer working as it used to. The dough is really sticky and super wet. I'm not sure what's going on. I'll try another recipe to see if it's the heating element. Here's hoping it's simply a fluke. I've owned it for under a year."
Jessina Arias,5,3/25/2024,,"I had to watch a bunch of YouTube videos to learn how to navigate this thing. The first time I attempted to make bread, I couldn't figure out when to get the hook out or how to put the thing on. But now I have the hang of it and the INCREDIBLE Kansas City bread It combines and bakes beautifully, and the aroma is heavenly. And cleanup afterward is a breeze."
Gregory Spurlock,5,1/6/2024,,"Generally this product does the excellent task. I've baked more than a dozen loaves, and they've all worked out reasonably well. The controls are very streamlined, and they've been designed to minimize button presses wherever possible. The cake cycle I tried but didn't really work with the banana bread I made. As with anything, you're going to have some trial and error with the recipes. If you want to avoid warming up the liquid, instant yeast is most certainly preferable to active dry yeast. I am still working on my pizza dough game. The ceramic pan is a delightful touch, and guarantees the loaves come sliding out without any trouble each and every time."

sumon johnson,5,3/12/2024,,This is the machine that I now bake all my bread in and I no longer buy any from the store. The sign seemed sensible enough — there is a lot of salt in bread in these parts — but I couldn't help myself; most of the bread around here is just way too salty for my taste. This bread maker helps me reduce my salt intake.
Thomas Caruso,3,4/7/2023,,"I've had this thing for several months, and I've baked with it multiple times, but my go-to dough recipe is no longer working as it used to.

Juno Pierre-Louis,5,4/28/2024,,"This one is incredible and so versatile! It has so many different bread and baking options. And their customer service team is amazing and responds really quickly. We needed a stir for the bread pan, and they immediately sent one out. You've really found the top-notch product for your kitchen!"
Michael Veach,2,2/21/2023,,"This machine is great and really easy to use, but it does walk around when making bread. On my third use it literally fell off the counter and broke -- so obviously not happy about that. I had a good cry, and then I realized my dough was fine. Although the machine was ruined and the control panel came off, its cords were good. I was able to re-attach everything, rebooted it, and now I'm back to baking bread. A bit frustrated still, I guess."
Mamu Bimpe,5,2/25/2024,,"I just received my bread machine and made a loaf right away. It turned out fantastic! The instructions are a little strange (they're probably translated) but aren't hard to follow. It has a few recipes in it, and I tried the milky bread. Here's a tip: Use the measuring cups that came with it and weigh your flour. It's pretty simple. I also elected to purchase the 4 year protection plan because I read a few reviews stating how these machines tend to break down. Here's hoping this one sticks and provides delicious bread for years! I'm very happy with how it's doing!"
Bryan Giovanni Alvarez,5,12/23/2023,,"I love this thing bread machine! It rests solidly on the counter without shaking or threatening to topple, as my last one did. The menu options are a bit odd, so it can take some getting used to that there is no “basic” option — just select “soft bread” instead. Also, you don't have to use the “raw dough” setting on most types of dough. Cleaning the bowl is relatively simple, though the paddle tends to remain in the pan. I look at that as a positive, because then I don't have to extract it from the baked loaf. Overall, I'm really happy with it and use it 2-3 times a week!"
trent long,3,6/20/2023,,"What I wish (super wish) is that rather than having dried meat floss, it would include a dough cycle to make rolls. I used it for the first time, I used the basic bread setting, but pulled the dough out before it started baking. I have no idea what the toast setting is for. I only wish the manual explained clearly what each setting does!"
Jesus Venegas,5,11/26/2023,,"After using this for a couple of months, my paddle was starting to chip, and I had been super gentle with it, just hand-washing it. I contacted the company to see if I could purchase a new paddle since I was disappointed that it got chipped so quickly. They also promptly sent me a brand new bread maker! They clearly put a lot of faith in their products. I'm glad I decided to get it. But I'm not a fan of their recipe book because the measurements can be confusing. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase!"
Bogdan Hart,4,9/11/2023,,"This bread maker is awesome, but good luck getting customer service to have a new instruction manual sent if you lose the original!

Bradley Gale,5,11/23/2023,,"As a disabled person, I sometimes find it really difficult to deal with things correctly. But this bread machine is an absolute game changer! It makes great bread and is so easy for me to lift and handle. I really like its design and simplicity of use. So glad I purchased this, would absolutely consider other products from this brand in the future!”"
Gregory armstrong,5,4/15/2024,,"I've attempted bread making in the past, but it never came out the way I hoped. Well, I bought this bread machine to see if it would help. I was so amazed by how it worked perfectly! It was so easy to use, and the bread was amazing! I'm going to be using it a ton.”"
larry laforce,5,3/11/2024,,"When I first started making the bread, I thought to myself it might not turn out very good, but once we figured out what recipe worked, it was really food — I was surprised. I just feel like the machine does the work for you, and truthfully the added bonus is when that bread starts to bake and the house smells incredible. And we've been enjoying the yogurt we can make with it, too. At first we only wanted it for bread, but the yogurt has certainly been a wonderful bonus!"
D Rodriguez,5,11/3/2023,,"My trusty Oster bread machine finally died on me, so I figured I'd put this brand to the test. I had had it for a long time, and really satisfied, but wanted to change it for something with 4+ reviews, and this one really hit the spot. I was looking for something in the same price range too, and it matched,” So, I've been experimenting quite a bit with it with different kinds of bread, and it does amazing! It does bake a little darker than my previous machine, but I've come to prefer that. I normally leave it on medium, but on this machine medium's a little dark. In all honesty, this is a very nice product for the price, so I'm fully willing to give a solid 5 star rating to this!"
Tom Bozek,4,7/29/2023,,"After months of deliberating, I ultimately settled on this one. And I am quite pleased with its performance! It has a lot of great features and is extremely easy to use. One downside is that, if you're making a 2-pound loaf, it might get a little messy on top, and it can be a bit tricky to clean up afterward. Plus it runs for three hours, so it can become quite hot in that period before needing to cool down to prevent overheating. Removing the bucket can be somewhat challenging as the handle is pretty weak. But overall, excellent value for the money with the features you get!"
Mike,5,11/7/2023,,"I purchased this bread machine to replace my old one after 25 years of loyal service finally gave up after baking tons of bread and batches of dough. I was super excited to get it because it has more features, like making jam and more, too. I've already made three loaves in just two days! And I can still apply all my old cookbooks and recipes as well as the new ones that came with this machine. Nothing beats fresh bread, and I'm very happy with this upgraded machine. I look forward to using it for many years to come!"
Tricia Townzen,5,4/2/2024,,"Replaced an old Cuisinart that struggled with whole wheat bread. We're very pleased with the results and the bowl itself. The paddle sometimes gets stuck, and the machine makes a little noise when adding ingredients, but all in all, we love the bread it produces!"
Travis Woodbury,3,6/22/2023,,"I did make some decent bread but it could use some clearer instructions. I have never used a bread maker before. Using the settings wasn't too complicated, but clearer guidance about what order to add ingredients would have helped. The loaf was flavorful but so much denser than what I get with my Bosch and baked in the oven."
Andrew Schild,5,2/27/2024,,"I've owned this bread machine for a couple years now, and it's my favorite! I use the gluten-free setting for my gluten-free bread and it comes out wonderful. My absolute favorite feature is the ceramic coating — I spent hours searching for a bread maker that didn't have nonstick coating, especially on the paddle. I have contacted their customer service a few times and they are always very prompt and helpful. I would absolutely order from them again!"
Saul Piñeiro,3,6/17/2023,,"The inside of the bread is soft, the outside nice and crusty. But I discovered that it produces much smaller loaves than my old, inexpensive bread machine. It has the smallest capacity, maxing out at a 900-gram loaf made with only 2 1/2 cups of flour, when my previous machine could accommodate 4 cups. So if you're a family of four and love that kind of classic European bread, you'll be making a loaf a day — maybe two, if guests come over. On the plus side, the bread seems to come out really well (I made white bread). I really liked the ceramic pan, which is why I chose this machine to begin with, but I only wish it could handle a bigger batch."
Wayne Hensche,5,2/20/2024,,"Riding high thanks to the fact I found this super easy to use and that it does exactly what it says on the tin. It doesn't take up too much counter space and is relatively quiet, too. Since getting it, I've used it maybe six times, and each loaf has turned out great. I'm very happy with this and would absolutely recommend to others. “I want to be baking every minute that I can. Clean-up is a breeze as well."
JUAN G ROJAS,5,10/29/2023,,"I'm currently having fun with this cheap bread machine that makes it possible for me to make my very own loaf. I mostly use it for mixing and kneading my dough — there's no time limit on how long I'm allowed to knead! When that's done, the inside of the machine sits at about 77°F (25°C). I can allow the dough to rise as long as I wish. From there, I give it a spatula punch down, then let it rise again. Then it's time to bake, and I get to choose the baking time anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour and 10 minutes. It does have options for whole wheat, French bread, sourdough, jam, yogurt and cake, but I haven't tried those yet."
James Rock,5,2/10/2024,,I am so pleased with my new bread maker! I haven't used the recipes from the manual; I've just Googled recipes. I have cooked Jalapeno bread before and it never fails. I would certainly repurchase this. The only downside is that the paddle is a little fiddly to get out for cleaning.
Shamia Hill,4,9/24/2023,,"So I was a bit nervous to test this bread maker, since I can't use a KitchenAid, and I live in an energy-efficient-savvy kind of place. But I plugged it in and it worked like a charm! It's super easy to use and quiet enough. I highly recommend it, as the bread looks amazing when it comes out! It is a little sweeter than I like when I make it according to the recipe but everything else is perfect — the texture is spot on and the crust is just divine. Perfect for saving space and great for an energy-efficient home. One thing I'm confused by, though — why does almost every recipe require powdered milk?"
Serpil Gulen,4,8/12/2023,,"So I splurged, and my initial loaf was magnificent! It's so pretty (I have the silver one), and it fits beautifully on my counter. But I saw that some ingredients are in milliliters and others in ounces, which can get a little bit confusing. The measuring cup helps, but I wish there was more clarity around the cycle times. When I realized that I just wanted to stop the machine before it reached the warming cycle, I didn't know how to do so, so I unplugged it. I hope that was okay! I'm about to find out when I bake my next loaf. Just my two cents!"

Fredi Mitchell,5,2/22/2024,,"The machine is very easy to use, although the user manual needs to be rewritten by someone fluent in English. Send in your warranty card or register online, I recommend. And after doing so, I discovered a much better quick-start guide and a lovely recipe book — all in PDF format!"
Suzan zaki,5,4/9/2024,,"It is so user friendly, it's perfectly mixes and bakes, and clean up is so easy! In the week since I've had it, I've made three loaves: white bread, French bread, sourdough, and they all turned out fantastic. A note, if you're doing sourdough, stick to 1 or 1.5 pounds … a 2-pound loaf overflows inside the pan."
Andy Almarode,3,4/10/2023,,"I have really enjoyed using this for over two years. I mostly use it to make simple loaves of bread. However, I attempted to make whole wheat bread last week, and it slid off the counter while it was being kneaded. To be clear, this was not my fault; it was located well back from the edge. I contacted the company because the door hinge broke and I wanted to see if I could get a replacement part. But when I went to their website, I found only a phone number — no address, no email, no other way to reach out. I attempted to call that number, only to find it was disconnected. I'm honestly kind of frustrated with this situation."
mark wang,5,3/8/2024,,"Recipes are easy to follow, though they're all in grams. I may have to get one of those measuring cups that has grams on it to make it easier to convert from cups to grams for this here in the U.S. What a wonderful bread maker! It works super well, would definitely recommend it to anyone."
Gregory Spurlock,5,1/6/2024,,"Generally this product does the excellent task. I've baked more than a dozen loaves, and they've all worked out reasonably well.

Carlos Castillo,4,8/16/2023,,"I made two loaves of bread and it was super easy! The “recipe book” was fairly simple, so if you're expecting more detailed, you'd better pick up an actual cookbook. The instructions aren't exactly crystal clear but it's so simple that you can work things out. I'm overall very interested to see if this works for me, and it's for sure a good deal!"

Gary kern,5,2/27/2024,,"I just baked my first loaf, and it was so good! The crust is gorgeous and the inside is light and airy. It's much quieter than my old bread maker, which is a nice plus.

Rebecca Rector,5,2/3/2024,,"I went through two other bread makers before finding this gem, and I never looked back! The non-stick coating makes it really easy to scrape the bottom of the bread pan and take the bread out after baking. It browns nice and gives the dough a really good kneading. And the paddle stays in the pan, not in the bread. The only downside I've noticed is that the handle of the pan could be wider; sometimes it gets a little hung up in the bread while it's baking, and I have to shake it a little to free it. But other than that, it's a keeper!"
Ralph Byrd,5,2/11/2024,,"This is my first experience with a bread maker and I'm so glad I choose this one! I spent literally days researching and comparing various models before deciding on this one, and I'm happy I picked it! I'm not particularly good at baking, but my husband suggested I try a bread maker. It's super simple to use. The pictures I posted are of the first loaf I made, and it was great! It was moist and soft inside with good crispy crust. I made use of the first setting with their soft bread recipe for a 1lb loaf. I can't wait to attempt more bread!"

Roxana Collins,4,7/16/2023,,"I highly recommend this breadmaker! It's cute, small and so simple to use and clean. My loaves have been very successful. But I wish the directions were a wee bit better; some of the print is pretty small and not easy to read. On the other hand, the functions on the LED screen were rather simple. It's also fun to see the dough swell through its tiny window. The only caveat is that I think the handle on the mixing bowl feels somewhat fragile, so I preferred not to twist it to unlock the pan, and just let it cool down first. But overall, it's a fantastic choice for anyone who is new to bread machines and wants to try their hand at it!"

Joseph Bello,5,4/1/2024,,"And I had been using this bread machine for close to a year now and I really love it! I use it for making our sandwich bread every other week, and I like to take advantage of all its different functions. And one of the things I love is that it does not budge on the counter when it's mixing and kneading — it's certainly much better than my KitchenAid, which tends to overheat when it's dealing with dough. The only downside so far is that the ceramic has chipped a bit on the stirring paddle and a little on the bread pan (despite the fact that I hand wash everything using soft sponges), as another poster wrote. I mentioned to customer service and they responded very quickly to assist me!"
Carlos Castillo,4,8/16/2023,,"I made two loaves of bread and it was super easy! The “recipe book” was fairly simple, so if you're expecting more detailed, you'd better pick up an actual cookbook. The instructions aren't exactly crystal clear but it's so simple that you can work things out. I'm overall very interested to see if this works for me, and it's for sure a good deal!"
Alicia Capodici,5,7/21/2024,,"I had a minor defect on my bread pan, but they immediately put it right."
ronald Wheat,5,3/7/2024,,"I have been using it for a couple of days and the machine is great, I'm really loving it. I had a hard time with the measurements at first but I am happy with it in the end."
ROBERT A MELTZER,5,11/28/2023,,"So simple to use, really, so basic. Plus, it's a breeze to store! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to make fresh bread whenever they want."
Jayden Collins,4,8/13/2023,,"For the past three months, I've been baking at least two gluten-free loaves a week. My own recipe is a charm on the GF setting (9)! It's brightened up my home quite a bit, this machine."
xiaopeng zhang,5,3/21/2024,,"I have been using this bread machine weekly for the last two years, and its still going strong and making wonderful bread every time. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a bread machine!"
juan chan,2,3/3/2023,,"I liked the look of this adorable, compact bread maker, but was extremely disappointed when I discovered that an insect had gotten stuck in the screen! So, I'm for sure going to be returning it. I anticipated an improved standard of quality control."

Richard Barela,3,4/17/2023,,I make sourdough bread pretty much every week so I thought I'd try this one because it said it was good for it. I think it took me about 10 months to realize that maybe they didn't really turn out the way I really wanted it to.
Anthony Petrella,4,7/1/2023,,"I ended up making two loaves: one French and one whole wheat, and both were great! And I rated it four out of five star, because although the description has it as having a sourdough setting, it actually does not."
Nadege Sambour,3,6/13/2023,,"I hadn't used it in five months, and decided to bake some bread today, but it is making all these weird squeaking noises and I can't let that go on, LOL. Should I oil it or what?"
PRZEMYSLAW GRYGLAK,5,2/22/2024,,"This is by far the best bread maker I've ever owned. It is super easy to use and clean and it really does make good bread, which is the only thing that really matters!"
Rigoberto Marta,5,11/1/2023,,"And it has a really improved ceramic nonstick coating as compared to Teflon. The clean up is super easy, no hassle at all. I'll say more once I've used it for a bit."
Yawo Tenu,4,9/12/2023,,"It looks great, the items look how they were described, but I haven't attempt to use it yet. The box claims to check the instructions, but as I opened it, there are no instructions included."
Laura Velasco,5,12/24/2023,,Just baked my first loaf of sweet bread. I used the preset setting to ensure it was ready bright and early. The smell was unbelievable! The bread was beautiful. So good— I'm really enjoying this machine. I think sourdough is my next attempt!

Annalisa Delgrosso,5,11/24/2023,,"I purchased this to aid in making low carb bread, and it was super easy to use. 02:43 — I can easily stay on my diet without making any effort. So now, all that is left for me to do now is perfect my recipe!"

Robin DiLucia,5,2/6/2024,,"I'm not very good at baking but this machine made it so easy. The instructions need some serious work — they're badly translated — but if you take your time, you'll figure it out!"

Ann Banks,4,8/22/2023,,"Overall, the bread maker is doing an excellent work. The only problem I have is with the kneading paddle it snaps into place, and it is really difficult to remove after the bread is done baking for cleaning."

Laura Cisneros,3,4/13/2023,,"The machine isn't that great. It does well enough for cakes, but it's not great for bread. Seriously if you're the one making the food, don't bother with the recipe book! It only ends up with food being wasted!"
