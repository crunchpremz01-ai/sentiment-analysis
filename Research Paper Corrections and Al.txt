# Research Paper Corrections and Alignments
## Comprehensive List of Required Changes

---

Important Note about "SVM" in the title:
Even though your actual implementation uses an ensemble of 3 models:

LinearSVC (Support Vector Machine)
Logistic Regression
Bagged SVM

...the title focusing on "SVM" is still academically appropriate because:

2 out of 3 models are SVM-based (LinearSVC + Bagged SVM)
SVM is the dominant/primary algorithm in your ensemble
Academic convention allows highlighting the main technique even when using ensembles
The title would be too long if you listed all three: "Using SVM, Logistic Regression, and Bagged SVM Ensemble"

What you SHOULD clarify in the paper:
Instead of changing the title, make sure your paper clearly states in the methodology/abstract:

"While the system is titled using SVM, the actual implementation employs an ensemble voting classifier comprising Linear Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Bagged SVM to achieve 89.37% accuracy."

Conclusion:
Keep your title as-is.

- Web Scraping: 20-40 seconds (2-4 seconds per page)
- ML Prediction: 0.5 seconds (~0.01 seconds per review)
- Data Processing: 5-10 seconds
- Total Average: 25-60 seconds

The system achieves the target of <30 seconds under optimal 
network conditions, with variance primarily due to web scraping 
speed dependent on network connectivity and server response times."
```

#### Required Changes:
```
ADD NEW SECTION in "Advanced Features" or "System Features":

"Confidence Threshold Filtering

The system implements an adjustable confidence threshold feature 
that allows users to filter predictions based on model certainty:

- Default: Includes all predictions regardless of confidence
- 70%: Includes only predictions with ≥70% confidence
- 80%: Includes only predictions with ≥80% confidence  
- 90%: Includes only predictions with ≥90% confidence

Example Application:
For 50 reviews processed with 80% threshold:
- 38 reviews meet confidence threshold → Included in results
- 12 reviews below threshold → Counted but excluded

This feature enables users to prioritize prediction quality over 
quantity, particularly useful for critical business decisions 
requiring high certainty. The system tracks both included and 
filtered review counts in the metadata."
```

## STRUCTURAL ADDITIONS NEEDED

### 16. **ADD: Character-Level Vectorization Explanation**

#### Current Gap:
- Paper doesn't explain character-level TF-IDF

#### Required Addition:
```
ADD NEW SUBSECTION under "Step 5: Character-Level TF-IDF":

"Rationale for Character-Level Features:

Character-level TF-IDF vectorization captures patterns that 
word-level analysis misses:

1. Misspellings and Variations:
   - "gooood" vs "good" (emphasis through repetition)
   - "amazinggg" vs "amazing"

2. Case Sensitivity Patterns:
   - "AMAZING" vs "amazing" (emphatic capitalization)
   - "WoW" vs "wow"

3. Punctuation Patterns:
   - "!!!" vs "!" (intensity markers)
   - "..." vs "." (trailing emphasis)

4. Character N-grams (2-4 characters):
   - Bigrams: "Go", "oo", "od"
   - Trigrams: "Goo", "ood"
   - 4-grams: "Good"

This multi-level analysis improves robustness against informal 
writing styles common in e-commerce reviews."
```

---

### 17. **ADD: Preprocessing Pipeline Visualization**

#### Current Gap:
- No clear flowchart for text preprocessing

#### Required Addition:
```

[Double Negation Detection]
    ↓
Marked: "This is POSITIVE_SIGNAL at all!"
    ↓
[Idiom Detection]
    ↓
(No idioms detected)
    ↓
[Contraction Expansion]
    ↓
(No contractions)
    ↓
[Negation Scope Marking]
    ↓
Final: "This is POSITIVE_SIGNAL at all!"

This preprocessing ensures complex linguistic patterns are 
properly represented before feature extraction and 
classification."
```

---

### 18. **ADD: Confidence Score Calculation**

#### Current Gap:
- Doesn't explain how confidence is calculated

#### Required Addition:
```
ADD SECTION "Confidence Score Computation":

"The confidence score represents the model's certainty in its 
prediction, calculated as follows:

For Voting Classifier with Probability Estimation:
1. Each sub-model provides probability distribution
2. Probabilities are averaged across all models
3. Confidence = max(averaged_probabilities)

Example:
Review: "Great product!"

Model Predictions:
- LinearSVC:    [Neg: 0.05, Neu: 0.10, Pos: 0.85]
- Logistic:     [Neg: 0.03, Neu: 0.12, Pos: 0.85]
- Bagged SVM:   [Neg: 0.08, Neu: 0.08, Pos: 0.84]

Averaged:       [Neg: 0.053, Neu: 0.100, Pos: 0.847]

Final Prediction: Positive
Confidence Score: 0.847 (84.7%)

Higher confidence indicates greater model certainty, with 
scores ≥0.8 considered highly confident predictions."

## TERMINOLOGY STANDARDIZATION

### 27. **Consistent Terminology**

```
STANDARDIZE throughout paper:

PREFERRED TERMS:
- "Ensemble model" (not "ensemble classifier")
- "Word-level TF-IDF" and "Character-level TF-IDF" (be explicit)
- "Linguistic feature engineering" (not just "feature engineering")
- "89.37% accuracy" (exact, not rounded)
- "ScraperAPI" (specific service name)
- "Confidence threshold" (not "confidence filter")
- "Session-based analysis" (describe async architecture)
- "Real-time progress tracking" (not just "progress updates")
```
